# Fuel Reduction Cost Simluator

FRCS is used for estimating costs for fuel reduction treatments involving removal of trees of mixed sizes in the form of whole trees, logs, or chips from a forest. It was originally a spreadsheet application published by U.S. Forest Service, and is now updated, improved, and coded by UC Davis CEC group, funded by California Energy Commission.
